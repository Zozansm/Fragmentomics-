# Fragmentomics: Analysis of Fragment End Motifs in cfDNA

Welcome to the official repository for the **Fragmentomics** Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project. This study explores the diagnostic potential of **fragment end motifs (FEMs)** and **fragment size distributions** in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using data from patients with cancer and no cancer. The repository includes the full analysis pipeline implemented in **Bash** and **R**, with scripts for filtering sequencing data, computing motif frequencies, and visualizing results.

## üìñ Project Overview

### Introduction

Fragmentation patterns in cfDNA reflect biological processes like apoptosis and chromatin structure, and may carry diagnostic information. This study investigates whether **5‚Ä≤ end 4-mer motifs** and **fragment size** characteristics differ between cancer and control patients.

### Objectives

- Identify statistically significant differences in FEMs between cancer and control samples.
- Explore global diversity of FEMs using MDS.
- Visualize motif enrichment via heatmaps and boxplots.
- Evaluate motifs for biomarker potential.

## üß™ Methods Summary

1. **BAM Filtering** (`01_filter_bam.sh`)
   - Removes low-quality reads.
   - Restricts to autosomal chromosomes.
   - Prepares data for FEM extraction.

2. **Motif Extraction** (`02_extract_motifs.sh`)
   - Extracts 4-mer sequences from the 5‚Ä≤ ends of cfDNA fragments.
   - Uses reference genome via `bedtools getfasta`.

3. **Motif Frequency Analysis**
   - Build motif frequency matrix (`04_build_motif_matrix.R`).
   - Visualize FEMs in a clustered heatmap (`05_heatmap_fem.R`).
   - Test FEM-level differences (`compare_motifs_wilcox.R`).
   - Plot top motifs (`selectedMotifs_boxplot.R`).

4. **Statistical Testing**
   - Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare cancer vs. non-cancer.
   - Adjust p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

## üß¨ Results Summary

- Certain motifs (e.g., `TGTA`, `TATT`, `TAAA`) showed differential abundance between cancer and non-cancer groups.
- Global MDS did not significantly differentiate cancer status.
- Stratified heatmaps revealed clusters enriched in hematopoietic and metastatic cancers.

See figures and tables in the `plots/` or `fem_output/` directories for full visual results.
